# Rossmann-Retail-Store-Sales-Prediction-Capstone-Project-UC-Denver

Attached is a term paper for the Masters degree in Business Analytics at UC Denver. The paper was written with Markdown to display important code (R) and the results from the project. 

**Objective**: This project is based on a Kaggle competition that ran during the fall of 2015. The data provided by Dr. Pfeil were **slightly different** from the dataset provided by Kaggle to ensure a fair competition. We forecast sales using store, promotion, and competitor data for Rossmann Drug Stores, which operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. 

_Deliverable_ Each group submitted several predictions, and the groups competed to create the best model based on the lowest RMSPE, just like in a Kaggle competition. We predicted 6 weeks of daily sales for 1,000 stores located across Germany.
