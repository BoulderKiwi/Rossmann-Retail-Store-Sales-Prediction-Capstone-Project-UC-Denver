## Rossmann-Retail-Store-Sales-Prediction-Capstone-Project-UC-Denver

Attached is a term paper for the Master’s degree in Business Analytics at UC Denver. The paper was written with R-Markdown to display important code (R) and the results from the project. 

**Objective:** This project is based on a Kaggle competition that ran during the fall of 2015. The data provided by Dr. Pfeil were **slightly different** from the dataset provided by Kaggle to ensure a fair competition. We forecast sales using store, promotion, and competitor data for Rossmann, which operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. 

_Deliverable_ Each group submitted several predictions, and the groups competed to create the best model based on the lowest RMSPE, just like in a Kaggle competition. We predicted 6 weeks of daily sales for 1,000 stores located across Germany.

_Stretch Goal_  I petitioned the University to enroll in this even though I lacked the prerequisites. I was motivated by the fact that a professor I respected, Dr. Kochenberger, gave high praise to Dr. Pfeil, the instructor of the course. Dr. Pfeil received her Ph.D. from MIT and it was unclear if I would get this opportunity again. I worked long hours to fill my knowledge gaps, but as expected, the sacrifice paid off.
